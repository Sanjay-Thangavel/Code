Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N, rotate it by D elements (clockwise). 

Input:
The first line of the input contains T denoting the number of testcases. First line of each test case contains two space separated elements, N denoting the size of the array and an integer D denoting the number size of the rotation. Subsequent line will be the N space separated array elements.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, output the rotated array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 200
1 <= N <= 107
1 <= D <= N
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
